## **System Overview**

OpenWork is a sophisticated multi-chain decentralized freelancing platform operating across 4 blockchain networks using LayerZero v2 for cross-chain messaging and Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for USDC payments. The system implements a complex tokenomics model with governance, dispute resolution, and automated reward distribution.

- **Peer Configuration**: Each bridge configured with authorized peers
- **Message Verification**: Cryptographic validation of all cross-chain messages
- **Fee Management**: Dynamic fee calculation with multi-chain batching support
- **Upgrade Coordination**: Centralized upgrade commands from Main DAO

### **CCTP Integration**

- **Domain Mapping**: 
  - Ethereum Sepolia: Domain 0
  - OP Sepolia: Domain 2  
  - Arbitrum Sepolia: Domain 3
- **Mint Recipients**: Flexible destination addressing for cross-chain payments
- **Fee Distribution**: Automated winner payouts in Native Athena disputes

### **Tokenomics Architecture**

#### **Reward Band System (Native Rewards)**
| Band | Platform Volume Range | OW Tokens per USDT | Use Case |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 0 | 0 - 500K | 100,000 | Early adoption incentive |
| 1 | 500K - 1M | 50,000 | Growth phase |
| 2 | 1M - 2M | 25,000 | Scaling phase |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 19 | 131M+ | 0.19 | Mature platform |

#### **Governance Action Unlocking**
- Users earn tokens through job payments (based on current band)
- Tokens remain locked until governance actions performed
- Each governance action unlocks tokens equal to current band rate
- Cross-chain sync enables Main Chain voting with earned tokens

---

## **Security Model**

### **Access Control**
- **Multi-signature Requirements**: Critical functions require governance approval
- **Role-based Permissions**: Granular access control across contracts
- **Bridge Authorization**: Only authorized contracts can send cross-chain messages
- **Upgrade Protection**: UUPS upgrades require DAO authorization

### **Economic Security**
- **Dispute Stakes**: Users stake tokens to participate in dispute resolution
- **Governance Stakes**: Minimum stake required for proposal creation  
- **Earned Token Voting**: Voting power tied to actual platform usage
- **CCTP Security**: Leverages Circle's institutional-grade infrastructure

### **Cross-Chain Security**
- **Message Validation**: LayerZero's security stack with DVNs and executors
- **Peer Verification**: Only configured peers can send messages
- **Upgrade Coordination**: Centralized but governance-controlled upgrades
- **Fee Protection**: CCTP integration prevents payment manipulation

---

## **Data Flow Examples**

### **Example 1: Cross-Chain Job Posting Flow**
1. User posts job on OP Sepolia LOWJC with milestone payments
2. LOWJC sends job data to Native Bridge via LayerZero
3. Native Bridge routes to NOWJC on Arbitrum
4. NOWJC validates and stores in Genesis, processes rewards
5. Job becomes visible across all connected chains

### **Example 2: Cross-Chain Dispute Resolution**
1. Dispute raised on ETH Sepolia Athena Client with CCTP fee payment
2. Fee routed to Native Athena via CCTP for instant settlement
3. Dispute message sent to Native Chain via LayerZero bridge
4. Native Athena processes voting with stake + earned token power
5. Winner determined, funds released via CCTP, fees distributed proportionally

### **Example 3: Earned Token Governance Flow**
1. User completes jobs on Native Chain, earns tokens in current band
2. Native Rewards calculates claimable tokens based on governance actions
3. User performs governance action (voting/proposing) in Native DAO
4. Native DAO triggers governance action increment in NOWJC
5. Voting power synced to Main Chain for cross-chain governance participation
